# Eml File Generator

Program that generates an .eml file and exports it to the user's pwd. This was manly created for the automatization of one of my tasks at work. 

Libraries used: sys, datetime, strings. 

*New version is WIP*

At the moment the only new addition to the code is a translator, ASCII logo and some aesthetic changes.
